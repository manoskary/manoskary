### Hello

I'm Emmanouil Karystinaios a Post-Doctoral Researcher in Music Information Retrieval.
Currently, I'm working on the Automatic Analysis of Music using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Optical Music Recognition, and on Generative Music Medicine, exploring the use and controlability of AI-generated music in therapeutic contexts.
